# Ride Matching Platform - Proof of Concept

This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a **ride matching platform** that can handle **1 million requests per second**, inspired by real-world implementations.

## ** Tech Stack**
### **Core Technologies Used**
- **FastAPI** - Lightweight and high-performance API framework for backend services.
- **Apache Cassandra** - NoSQL distributed database for storing driver locations with time-to-live (TTL).
- **Redis** - In-memory database for **fast geospatial lookups** of active drivers.
- **Kafka** - Distributed message broker for handling driver location updates in real-time.
- **H3 (Geospatial Indexing Library)** - Used for efficient **hexagonal grid-based geospatial indexing**.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerized deployment for all services.

---
## ** System Overview**
This PoC mimics how ride-matching platforms efficiently find nearby drivers **at scale**. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### **1Ô∏è Driver Location Updates (Kafka Producer)**
- A **Simulator Service** continuously generates **1000 driver location updates** every **30 seconds**.
- These updates are **published to Kafka** in the `driver-locations` topic.

### **2Ô∏è Location Processing (Kafka Consumer)**
- A **Consumer Service** subscribes to the Kafka `driver-locations` topic and processes each message.
- **H3 hexagonal grid indexing** is used to assign each driver to a **grid cell**.
- Driver locations are stored in **Cassandra with a TTL** of **1 hour**, ensuring old locations expire automatically.
- Driver locations are also **cached in Redis** for quick lookups.

### **3Ô∏è Finding Nearby Drivers (API Request)**
- The **FastAPI backend** exposes an endpoint to fetch nearby drivers.
- The request contains **user latitude, longitude, and search radius**.
- The system:
  - Converts **lat/lon to an H3 hex index**.
  - Uses **H3's `grid_disk` function** to find neighboring cells.
  - Looks up drivers in **Redis** for ultra-fast response times.
  - Falls back to **Cassandra** if Redis misses the data.
- Returns a list of **nearby drivers sorted by proximity**.

## ** Docker-Based Local Setup**

### ** Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```

### ** Step 2: Start the System**
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start:
- **Cassandra** (Database)
- **Redis** (Cache Layer)
- **Kafka & Zookeeper** (Message Queue)
- **FastAPI Backend** (Driver Matching API)
- **Kafka Consumer** (Processes driver locations)
- **Simulator** (Generates driver location updates)

## ** API Endpoints**

### ** Get Nearby Drivers**
**URL:** `GET /nearby-drivers`

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter  | Type  | Description  |
|------------|------|--------------|
| `lat`      | float | User's latitude |
| `lon`      | float | User's longitude |
| `radius`   | int   | Search radius in hexagonal rings (default: 1) |

**Example Request:**
```sh
GET http://localhost:5000/nearby-drivers?lat=28.7041&lon=77.1025&radius=1
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "nearby_drivers": [
    "driver_23",
    "driver_87",
    "driver_192"
  ]
}
```

---
## ** Performance Testing & Results**
### **Load Testing Details**
- A script was executed to simulate **1 million requests** to fetch nearby drivers.
- The API dynamically adjusted search radius between **1-5 KM**.
- The **Haversine formula** was used to calculate the distance between the user and each nearby driver.


### **Report Generation**
- The **Kafka Consumer** logs all processed driver locations into a CSV report.
- Sample CSV Output:
```csv
Driver ID, Latitude, Longitude, H3 Index, Timestamp
driver_23, 28.7032, 77.1015, 8928308280fffff, 2025-03-07T12:34:56
```

## ** Architecture Explained**

### **1Ô∏è Kafka-Based Driver Location Updates**
- The **simulator** generates fake driver movements and **publishes them to Kafka**.
- Kafka ensures **fault-tolerant, real-time message processing**.

### **2Ô∏è Cassandra as a Long-Term Storage Layer**
- Stores **driver locations with TTL (1 hour)** to automatically remove stale data.
- Allows **fast writes with partitioning on H3 index**.

### **3Ô∏è Redis for Fast Driver Lookup**
- Nearby drivers are first looked up in **Redis** (hot cache).
- If missing, data is fetched from **Cassandra**.

### **4Ô∏è H3 Geospatial Indexing**
- Converts **lat/lon to a hex index** (H3 grid resolution 9).
- **`grid_disk`** is used to efficiently **query adjacent hexagons**.

## ** Key Improvements Over Traditional Approaches**
| Approach | Challenge | Our Optimization |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Raw Lat/Lon Queries** | Inefficient for large-scale lookups | **H3 Geospatial Indexing** reduces query time |
| **SQL Joins for Distance Calculation** | High compute cost | **Redis caching + Cassandra partitioning** ensures fast lookup |
| **No Message Queue** | Handling **real-time updates** becomes complex | **Kafka decouples location updates from lookup queries** |

---
## ** Troubleshooting**

### **1Ô∏è Cassandra Connection Issue**
```sh
cqlsh cassandra 9042
```
If it fails, restart the Cassandra service:
```sh
docker-compose restart cassandra
```

### **2Ô∏è Kafka Not Processing Messages**
```sh
docker logs -f consumer
```
If there‚Äôs an error, restart Kafka:
```sh
docker-compose restart kafka
```

### **3Ô∏è API Not Returning Drivers**
- Ensure **simulator is running**:
  ```sh
  docker logs -f simulator
  ```
- Check if drivers exist in Cassandra:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM ride_matching.locations LIMIT 10;
  ```

## Comparison: H3 vs. Elasticsearch `geo_distance`

### 1Ô∏è H3-Based Approach (Current Solution)

#### üõ† How It Works
- Maps driver locations to **H3 hexagonal indexes**.
- **Finds nearby drivers** by querying **neighboring H3 cells**.
- **Uses Redis for caching**, falls back to Cassandra.

#### Pros
‚úî **Blazing Fast** (**O(1) in Redis**)  
‚úî **Scalable for millions of requests/sec**  
‚úî **Lower memory & CPU overhead**  
‚úî **Great for real-time ride-matching**

#### Cons
‚úñ **Less precise than `geo_distance`**  
‚úñ **Requires H3 pre-indexing**  
‚úñ **Hexagonal search radius is approximate**  

---

### 2Ô∏è Elasticsearch `geo_distance` Query

#### How It Works
- Stores `lat/lon` as **`geo_point`** in Elasticsearch.
- Uses **Haversine formula** to compute **exact distance**.

#### Pros
‚úî **Precise distance-based filtering**  
‚úî **Supports complex queries** (e.g., filter by rating, vehicle type)  
‚úî **No need for pre-indexing**

#### Cons
‚úñ **Slower than H3 for high-QPS**  
‚úñ **CPU-intensive on large datasets**  
‚úñ **Scaling challenges for millions of requests/sec**

## When to Use What?

| Use Case | **H3-Based Approach** | **Elasticsearch** |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Ride Matching (Millions of QPS)** | Best Choice | Too Slow |

## Future Enhancements
**Implement ETA Calculation** (ML-based estimations).
**Optimize Redis TTL** (Adjust expiration based on driver activity).
**Support Multi-Region Lookups** (Extend `grid_disk` radius dynamically).
